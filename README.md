## Customer Segmentation Project
For this project, we will be working with  online_transactions_cleaned table we have been querying from redshift.

This is the dataset where we carried out a series of transformations  and built an ETL pipeline  that cleans the data.

This ETL pipeline is in my [repository](https://github.com/nadiasao/ETL_pipeline_docker)
